# Overview
pyGSFLOW is a python package designed to create new GSFLOW integrated hydrologic 
models, read existing models, edit model input data, run GSFLOW models, process  
output, and visualize model data.

# Introduction
Hydrologic modeling has been steadily increasing in complexity over the years. 
The addition of new types of data sets and the need to represent the interaction 
between surface water and groundwater systems has been driving this complexity. 
Ignoring landscape changes in space and time and applying simple boundary conditions 
within hydrologic models is no longer adequate to address watershed and basin scale 
issues [@Fatichi:2016]. Instead, integrated hydrologic models (IHMs), that couple 
governing equations for surface water and groundwater flow, are used to represent 
feedback mechanisms between these systems.

Among these IHMs is GSFLOW simulation code [@Markstrom:2008] that 
simulates surface and subsurface hydrologic processes by integrating the 
Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) [@Markstrom:2015] and 
MODFLOW [@Harbaugh:2005; @Niswonger:2011] into a single code that 
simulates feedbacks between the two processes. Because modelers are moving 
toward simulating greater portions of the hydrologic cycle, larger datasets, 
from multiple sources are used to parameterize these models. Beyond the scope 
of example problems, most applied problems require custom workflows and code 
to process large datasets related to model inputs and outputs. Scripting languages 
like Python, R, and MATLAB make it easier to process large data sets and provide 
standard methods that can be used for developing, editing, and properly formatting 
model input files and for analyzing model output data. These developments have led 
to major advancements in model reproducibility and improvements in model 
applicability [@Bakker:2016; @Gardner:2018; @Ng:2018].

# Statement of need
GSFLOW model development previously has been a piecemeal approach. Arcpy-GSFLOW 
scripts [@Gardner:2018] or GSFLOW-GRASS packages have been used to 
process surface-water input data into model files. PRMS-Python 
[@Volk:2019] could be used to edit most of the PRMS inputs to 
GSFLOW. Finally, FloPy [@Bakker:2016; @Bakker:2021] could be used to edit 
most of the MODFLOW inputs to GSFLOW. This approach unfortunately is not tightly 
coupled and still requires  manual edits and additional external scripts to edit, 
run models, and process output data. Because of the complexity of integrated 
hydrologic models and the need for model reproductivity, a single integrated 
scripting package will help standardize and streamline model development and calibration. 

# pyGSFLOW
pyGSFLOW is a Python package for creating new GSFLOW models, importing existing 
models, running GSFLOW models, processing model outputs, and visualizing model 
data. Instead of working directly with formatted model input files, the pyGSFLOW 
Application Programming Interface (API)  allows the user to work with class-based 
methods to create GSFLOW [@Markstrom:2008], PRMS [@Markstrom:2015], MODSIM 
[@Labadie:2006] vectorized surface water operations networks, and 
MODFLOW [@Harbaugh:2005] model packages and binds them into a single integrated 
model instance. model packages and binds them into a single integrated model 
instance. pyGSFLOW leverages features from FloPy, an existing Python package 
for the MODFLOW suite of groundwater modeling software
[@Harbaugh:2005; @Niswonger:2011; @Panday:2013; @Langevin:2017] 
and extends the capabilities for integrated hydrologic models. pyGSFLOW 
relies on FloPy model and package objects and interfaces with these features 
to provide FloPy users with familiar code syntax and to ensure the 
long-term maintainability of the code base.

The pyGSFLOW package was developed for hydrologic modelers and researchers 
who are developing, calibrating, or running prediction scenarios with GSFLOW. 
The code base currently is being used for the development of several watershed 
scale hydrologic models for basins in the western U.S., including the example 
discussed below highlighting application to the Russian River basin and 
the Santa Rosa Plain (fig. 1) [@Woolfenden:2014; @Gardner:2018]. 

The Santa Rosa Plain (SRP) model [@Woolfenden:2014] is an IHM that was developed 
as a tool to provide scientific information to water managers about future 
climate-change scenarios. The SRP model applied four global-climate models and 
simulated relative change in water resources under each scenario. Prior to 
simulating future changes, the model was calibrated to historic groundwater and 
surface-water conditions. Part of the calibration process involved identifying 
sensitive and insensitive parameters. Calibration and sensitivity analysis experiments 
on model parameters provided insight into reducing model error when predicting results 
such as simulated streamflow (figure 1). In this example, the snarea_curve (snow 
depletion curve) and ssr2gw_rate (gravity reservoir to groundwater reservior 
routing coeficient) were identified as more sensitive parameters to model calibration 
than the gsflow_coef (linear groundwater discharge equation coeficient) (figure 1). Insights 
like these allow researchers to focus their calibration efforts on sensitive 
parameters and fix insensitive parameters, thus reducing the time and complexity 
of the calibration process. Although actual calibration generally is not done directly 
with pyGSFLOW, it provides an easy to use interface to update parameters based on grid 
cell location or parameter zone that can be used in conjuction with external 
calibration software.

The pyGSFLOW package also includes features to visualize input and output data 
spatially using Matplotlib [@Hunter:2007] plots and by exporting datasets to shapefile or the 
visualization toolkit (VTK) format [@Schroeder:2006]. By providing pyGSFLOW a GIS 
shapefile or list of hydrologic response unit (HRU) geometries, the code is able to 
plot and contour arrays of unique parameter values and is fully compatible with 
the FloPy plotting routines for MODFLOW. PRMS input parameter values can be layered 
over MODFLOW output and can potentially help identify trends and sensitive parameters 
controlling  trends in streamflow, recharge, and groundwater levels throughout the 
model. The ssr2gw_rate parameter, which scales the exchange between the PRMS gravity 
reservoir and the MODFLOW groundwater reservior in GSFLOW, can then be overlain on 
top of recharge arrays to inspect the input and output for correlated trends (figure 2). 
Figure 2 shows that in the western part of the basin, both the ssr2gw_rate and the 
relative amount of areal recharge is slightly greater than the eastern part of the 
basin. The simulated recharge data also shows the highest volume of recharge occurs 
along a few short losing stream reaches These insights can help the researcher adjust 
input parameters for both streamflow and groundwater-level calibration.

The online documentation for pyGSFLOW (https://pygsflow.github.io/pygsflowdocs/) contains 
API information for all major classes and methods and is updated with each new major 
release. In addition to the online documentation, sample Jupyter notebooks [@Kluyver:2016] 
are included in the repository to help users become familiar with the 
interface.

# Package architecture
The pyGSFLOW package includes the gsflow module and 5 sub-packages (figure 3):

   - gsflow: the gsflow module contains the integrated modeling object 
   GsFlowModel which allows the user to build new GSFLOW models and import 
   existing models. This module calls classes and methods from the following 
   5 sub-packages within pyGSFLOW.
   - prms: the prms sub-package contains classes and methods to build new PRMS 
   models, import existing PRMS models, edit model input data, and write PRMS 
   input data to file to parameter and data files.
   - modsim: the modsim sub-package contains classes that translate MODFLOW 
   model stream and lake networks into vectorized shapefile representations 
   that can be used to define surface water operation networks in MODSIM.
   - modflow: the modflow package contains modules and classes that interface 
   with FloPy and allow the user to create new MODFLOW packages, edit existing 
   packages, and write MODFLOW input data to file to its specific input file.
   - output: the output sub-package contains modules that allow the user to 
   define their surface water model discretization and visualize output data 
   via matplotlib plots.
   - utils: includes general use utilities that are integrated into built in 
   functions in the gsflow module, and prms, modflow, and modsim sub-packages.

# Conclusion
GSFLOW integrated hydrologic models simulate complex processes and interactions 
between surface-water and groundwater flow systems. Parameterizing these model 
processes requires large datasets from multiple sources to represent the hydrologic 
cycle. Previous approaches involved multiple disconnected scripts and packages that 
relied on proprietary code and makes reproducibility difficult. pyGSFLOW is a tightly 
coupled software package that allows the user to import all parts of their model into 
one script that helps to standardize and streamline model development, 
calibration, and output analysis.
