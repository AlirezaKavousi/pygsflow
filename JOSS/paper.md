# Overview
pyGSFLOW is a python package designed to create new GSFLOW integrated 
hydrologic models, read existing models, edit model input data, run GSFLOW 
models, process output, and visualize model data.

# Introduction
Hydrologic modeling has been steadily increasing in complexity over the years. 
The addition of new types of data sets and the need to represent the interaction 
between surface water and groundwater systems has been driving this complexity. 
Ignoring landscape changes in space and time and applying simple boundary 
conditions within hydrologic models is no longer adequate to address watershed 
and basin scale issues (Fatichi et al., 2016). Instead, integrated hydrologic 
models (IHMs), that couple governing equations for surface water and groundwater 
flow, are used to represent feedback mechanisms between these systems.

Among these IHMs is GSFLOW simulation code (Markstrom and others, 2008) that 
simulates surface and subsurface hydrologic processes by integrating the 
Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) (Markstrom and others, 2015) and 
MODFLOW (Harbaugh, 2005, Niswonger and others, 2011) into a single code that 
simulates feedbacks between the two systems. Because modelers are moving toward 
simulating greater portions of the hydrologic cycle, larger datasets, from 
multiple sources are used to parameterize these models. Beyond the scope of 
example problems, most applied problems require custom workflows and code to 
process large datasets related to model inputs and outputs. Scripting languages 
like Python, R, and MATLAB make it easier to process large data sets and 
provide standard methods that can be used for developing, editing, and properly 
formatting model input files and for analyzing model output data. These 
developments have led to major advancements in model reproducibility and 
improvements in model applicability (Bakker and others, 2016; Gardner and 
others, 2018; Ng and others, 2018).

# Statement of need
GSFLOW model development previously has been a piecemeal approach. Arcpy-GSFLOW 
scripts (Gardener and others, 2018) or GSFLOW-GRASS packages have been used to 
process surface water input data into model files. PRMS-Python 
(Volk and Turner, 2019) could be used to edit most of the PRMS inputs to 
GSFLOW. Finally, FloPy (Bakker and others, 2016; Bakker and others 2019) could 
be used to edit most of the MODFLOW inputs to GSFLOW. This approach 
unfortunately is not tightly coupled and still required manual edits and 
additional external scripts to edit, run models, and process output data. 
Because of the complexity of integrated hydrologic models and the need for 
model reproductivity, a single integrated scripting package will help 
standardize and streamline model development and calibration. 

# pyGSFLOW
pyGSFLOW is a Python package for creating new GSFLOW models, importing existing 
models, running GSFLOW models, processing model outputs, and visualizing model 
data. Instead of working directly with formatted model input files, the 
pyGSFLOW API allows the user to work with class-based methods to create GSFLOW 
(Markstrom and others, 2008), PRMS (Markstrom and others, 2015), MODSIM 
(Labadie and Larson, 2006) vectorized surface water operations networks, and 
MODFLOW (Harbaugh, 2005) model packages and binds them into a single integrated 
model instance. pyGSFLOW leverages features from FloPy, an existing Python 
package for the MODFLOW suite of groundwater modeling software 
(Harbaugh, 2005; Niswonger and others, 2011; Panday and others, 2013; 
Langevin and others, 2017) and extends the capabilities for integrated 
hydrologic models. pyGSFLOW relies on FloPy model and package objects and 
interfaces with these features to provide FloPy users with familiar code syntax 
and to ensure the long-term maintainability of the code base.

The pyGSFLOW package was developed for hydrologic modelers and researchers who 
are developing, calibrating, or running prediction scenarios with GSFLOW. The 
code base currently is being used for the development of several river-basin 
scale hydrologic models in western basins, including the example shown below 
highlighting application to the Russian River basin and the Santa Rosa Plain 
(fig. 1) (Woolfenden and Nishikawa, 2014; Gardner and others, 2016). 

The Santa Rosa Plain (SRP) model (Woolfenden and Nishikawa, 2014) is an IHM 
that was developed as a tool to provide scientific information to water 
managers about future climate change scenarios. The SRP model applied four 
global-climate models and simulated relative change in water resources under 
each scenario. Prior to simulating future change, the model was calibrated to 
historic groundwater and surface-water conditions. Part of the calibration 
process involves identifying sensitive and insensitive parameters. Calibration 
and sensitivity analysis experiments on model parameters can provide insight 
into reducing model error when predicting results such as simulated streamflow 
(figure 1). The snarea_curve (snow depletion curve) and ssr2gw_rate 
(gravity reservoir to groundwater reservior routing coeficient) are identified 
as more sensitive parameters to model calibration than the gsflow_coef 
(linear groundwater discharge equation coeficient) (figure 1). Insights like 
these allow researchers to focus their calibration efforts on sensitive 
parameters and fix insensitive parameters, thus reducing the time and 
complexity of the calibration process. Although actual calibration generally is 
not done directly with pyGSFLOW, it provides an easy to use interface to update 
parameters based on grid cell location or parameter zone that can be used in 
conjuction with external calibration software.

The pyGSFLOW package also includes features to visualize input and output data 
spatially using matplotlib plots and by exporting datasets to shapefile or the 
visualization toolkit (VTK) format. By providing pyGSFLOW a shapefile or list 
of hydrologic response unit (HRU) geometries, the code is able to plot arrays 
and contour arrays of unique parameter values and is fully compatible with the 
FloPy plotting routines for MODFLOW. PRMS input parameter values can be layered 
over MODFLOW output and can potentially help identify trends and sensitive 
parameters controlling those trends in streamflow, recharge, and groundwater 
levels throughout the model. The ssr2gw_rate parameter which scales the 
exchange between the PRMS gravity reservoir and the MODFLOW groundwater 
reservior in GSFLOW can then be overlain on top of recharge arrays to inspect 
the input and output for correlated trends (figure 2). Figure 2 shows that in 
the western part of the basin, both the ssr2gw_rate and the relative amount of 
areal recharge is slightly greater than the eastern part of the basin. The 
simulated recharge data also shows the highest volume of recharge occurs along 
a few short losing stream sections. These insights can help the researcher 
adjust input parameters for both streamflow and groundwater level calibration.

The online documentation for pyGSFLOW (https://pygsflow.github.io/pygsflowdocs/) 
contains API information for all major classes and methods and is updated with 
each new major release. In addition to the online documentation, sample Jupyter 
notebooks are included in the repository to help users become familiar with the 
interface.

# Package architecture
The pyGSFLOW package includes the gsflow module and 5 sub-packages (figure 3):

   - gsflow: the gsflow module contains the integrated modeling object 
   GsFlowModel which allows the user to build new GSFLOW models and import 
   existing models. This module calls classes and methods from the following 
   5 packages within pyGSFLOW.
   - prms: the prms sub-package contains classes and methods to build new PRMS 
   models, import existing PRMS models, edit model input data, and write PRMS 
   input data to file.
   - modflow: the modflow package contains modules and classes that interface 
   with FloPy and allow the user to create new MODFLOW packages, edit existing 
   packages, and write MODFLOW input data to file.
   - modsim: the modsim sub-package contains classes that translate MODFLOW 
   model stream and lake networks into vectorized shapefile representations 
   that can be used to define surface water operation networks in MODSIM.
   - output: the output sub-package contains modules that allow the user to 
   define their surface water model discretization and visualize output data 
   via matplotlib plots.
   - utils: includes general use utilities that are integrated into built in 
   functions in the gsflow module, and prms, modflow, and modsim sub-packages.

# Conclusion
GSFLOW integrated hydrologic models simulate complex processes and interactions 
between surface-water and ground-water flow systems. Parameterizing these model 
processes requires large datasets from multiple sources to represent the 
hydrologic cycle. Previous approaches involved multiple disconnected scripts 
and packages, some of which rely on proprietary code, which makes 
reproducibility difficult. pyGSFLOW is a tightly coupled software package, 
that allows the user to import all parts of their model in one script, which 
helps to standardize and streamline model development, calibration, and output 
analysis.
